"In C" (1964), by Terry Riley, is meant for any number of musicians and for any instrumentation. It is a series of 53 short musical phrases to be played by the entire ensemble in order, but asynchronously. An ostinato pulse is usually given by one instrument to keep time (typically a piano, playing the note 'C' in multiple octaves).

  At the start, players begin with phrase number 1, repeating, looping, or laying out and listening, *ad lib.* Players move on to the next phrase (in order) when they feel that the moment is right. Players should stay within 3 or 4 phrases of the rest of the group. This process continues until the ensemble has played through all 53 phrases.

A complete performance of 'In C' takes anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour and a half.
